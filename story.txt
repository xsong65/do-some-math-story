In University of Wisconsin - Madison, there is a boy named David who double majors in computer science and 
mathematics. David loves programming but math is a great pain to him. Now David is struggling on his 
abstract algebra courses. Let's help him. Here is a problem in David's homework: "Prove the Lagrange's 
Theorem." David says that he is going to pay 100000 dollars to anyone who helps him solve that.

To clarify the statement to be proved: Lagrange's theorem, in the mathematics of group theory, states that 
for any finite group G, the order (number of elements) of every subgroup H of G divides the order of G. 
The theorem is named after Joseph-Louis Lagrange.

Are we just helping one of our X team members solve their homework, we wonder.  Oh well, it doesn't 
matter, X teams gotta help each other out! The idea is that the translates of the subgroup H partition G. 
Using some set terminology we have learned in CS400, this means that the set of cosets (either left or 
right) of H in G form a disjoint collection of sets, whose union is all of G. Moreover, all of these 
translates have the same size, which is the size of the subgroup H.

In an effort to help his X team member complete his homework, even though we 
are unsure what the problem even means, we see the key word 'Lagrange'.
We work off of that, remembering our calc three we attempt to take partial
derivatives, multiply them by lambda, and set them equal to the partials
that come from the constraint. But wait! how does one take a derivative of 
a set. The X team member realizes he got lost and cant help.

Now, in our Xteam, it seems that David received the help from all of the team members. Therefore, everybody
here are supposed to get 100000 dollars from David! But wait a second! 100000 dollars? David said he was just 
kidding! Instead, he was really happy to give everyone a big warm hug to show
his appreciation! In Xteam, we are all
here to help each other!
